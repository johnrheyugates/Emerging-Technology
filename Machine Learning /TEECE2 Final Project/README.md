## 📌 Problem Definition

### **Research Question**
Are there identifiable lifestyle patterns among students who achieve high academic performance despite moderate study hours?

### **Objectives**
1. Identify clusters of students based on lifestyle habits
2. Predict exam scores using various lifestyle factors
3. Discover patterns in high-performing students with moderate study time

## 🧪 Project Structure

### 1. **Data Preprocessing**
- Loaded and cleaned dataset
- Treated `"0"` values in "Parental Education Level" as valid categorical entries
- Engineered new features:
  - `total_screen_time`: Sum of social media and Netflix hours
  - `study_to_screen_ratio`: Study efficiency metric

### 2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Explored distributions, correlations, and trends in lifestyle and academic features

### 3. **Clustering Analysis**
- Unsupervised learning to group students based on lifestyle patterns

### 4. **Regression Analysis**
- Predicted exam scores using multiple regression models

### 5. **Classification Task**
- Classified students into performance categories (e.g., high vs. low performers)

### 6. **Model Evaluation**
- Assessed model accuracy and identified the most impactful features using feature importance
